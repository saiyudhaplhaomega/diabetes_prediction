# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes using the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset** and a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook-based project includes:
- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model
- Evaluating model accuracy
- Visualizing SVM performance using a bar chart

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**, which contains medical data from female patients of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset includes features like:
- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

Target variable: `Outcome` (0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)
